# Digital Twin

## What is a Digital Twin?

A **digital twin** is a virtual model that accurately reflects a physical object. In manufacturing, a digital twin gathers system and process state data with the help of various IoT sensors and enterprise data to form a virtual model. This model is then used to run simulations, study performance issues, and generate possible insights.

Digital twins have become an imperative in today's data-driven businesses. They address a multitude of challenges within manufacturing, logistics, and transportation, including product design complexity, opaque supply chains, and poor quality management. By using digital twins, manufacturers can streamline and optimize all the processes in their value chain, from product development and design to operations and supply chain optimization.

## Why is this important?

Digital twin technology has made significant strides in improving operations and building agile supply chains. It provides us with the awareness of how long inventory will last, when to replenish, and how to minimize supply chain disruptions. Digital twins also allow for continuous quality checks on produced items, providing pre-emptive assurance of improved product quality. They create the opportunity to have multiple departments in sync by providing necessary instructions modularly to attain a required throughput. Additionally, customer feedback loops can be modeled through inputs, forming a closed loop providing an improved product design.
