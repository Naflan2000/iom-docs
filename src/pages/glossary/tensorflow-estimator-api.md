# Tensorflow Estimator API

**What is the Tensorflow Estimator API?** The Tensorflow Estimator API is a powerful tool for creating machine learning models that are both complete and intuitive. With the Estimator API, one can easily train, evaluate, and generate predictions for oneâ€™s model. There are two types of Estimators to choose from: pre-made Estimators or custom Estimators that you can write yourself. Best of all, estimators-based models can be run on local or distributed servers, and on CPUs, GPUs, or TPUs without any changes to your model.

Estimators encapsulate four main features: training, evaluation, prediction, and exporting your model for serving. They also come with numerous benefits, including simplified sharing of implementations between model developers, high-level intuitive code for easier model creation, and built-in customization with tf.keras.layers. Plus, Estimators make life easier by building graphs for you and providing a safely distributed training loop that controls all aspects of the training process.
