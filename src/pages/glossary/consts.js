      "AdaGrad is a family of sub-gradient algorithms for stochastic optimization. Gradient descent is the most commonly used optimization method in machine learning and deep learning algorithms. It's essential for training machine learning models. Below, we'll discuss the three primary types of gradient descent used in modern machine learning and deep learning algorithms, as well as the advantages of using AdaGrad.",
