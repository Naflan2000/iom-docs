# Data Transformation

## What Is Data Transformation?

Data transformation is the process of turning raw data into usable datasets that organizations can use to meet operational needs and create actionable insights. By manipulating datasets, the data transformation process generates insights that can be used to make business decisions. It's critical for realizing value from raw data and gives organizations the data they need to better understand the past, present, and future of their business.

## Why is Data Transformation important?

Data transformation is at the heart of ETL, which stands for extract, transform, and load. This is the process data engineers use to pull data from different sources, transform it into a usable and trusted resource, and load that data into the systems end-users can access and use downstream to solve business problems.

The data transformation process can be accomplished via several different techniques, depending on the data and end transformation goal. These may include data aggregation, data cleansing, data de-duplication, data derivation, data enrichment, data filtering, data integration, data joining, data splitting, data summarization, data validation, format revision, and key restructuring.

Optimizing data transformation performance is crucial to reduce costs and save time. Performance optimization techniques include data compaction, partitioning, file size tuning, data skipping and pruning, and data caching.

## Data Transformation 2.0

IOMETE offers essential tools for implementing and orchestrating data transformations and ETL on the Data Lakehouse Platform. IOMETE helps data engineering teams easily build and manage reliable batch and streaming data pipelines that deliver high-quality data. IOMETE offers an Airflow integration that empowers data teams to better automate and orchestrate data pipelines. Workflows integrate seamlessly with dbt, a tool that allows anyone on a data team to safely contribute to production-grade data pipelines and makes transformation faster and more secure.

By using data transformation techniques and tools, organizations can turn raw data into valuable insights that drive business growth and success.
