We are proud to announce that we have achieved SOC 2 Type I compliance in accordance with [American Institute of Certified Public Accountants](https://www.linkedin.com/company/american-institute-of-certified-public-accountants/) (AICPA) standards for SOC for Service Organizations also known as SSAE 18. Achieving this standard with an unqualified opinion serves as third-party industry validation that IOMETE provides enterprise-level security for customer data.

IOMETE provides a modern, fully-managed data stack that makes it easy and cost-effective to become data driven. IOMETE engaged fellow Y Combinator company Vanta to get ready for the audit and stay in compliance going forward. IOMETE was audited by [Prescient Assurance](https://www.linkedin.com/company/prescient-assurance/) , a leader in security and compliance attestation for B2B, SAAS companies worldwide.

An unqualified opinion on a SOC 2 Type I audit report demonstrates to IOMETEâ€™s current and future customers that their data is handled with the highest standard of security and compliance.
