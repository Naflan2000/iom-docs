Quickly move your MySQL tables to IOMETE Lakehouse using our Spark Job that's simple to configure. All you need to do is provide the settings, and the job will handle the rest. Choose how you want to transfer your data: either a full load or in smaller increments. Scroll down for more details on these sync options.

:::tip
If you want to make changes, you can copy the job and adjust it however you like.
:::

### Deployment

- In the left sidebar menu choose <FlexButton label='Spark Jobs'><Cpu size={20} color='#858c9c' weight="duotone"/></FlexButton>
- Click on <FlexButton label='Create' primary><Plus size={16} /></FlexButton>

Specify the following parameters (these are examples, you can change them based on your preference):

- **Name:** `mysql-db-sync`
- **Docker image:** `iomete/iomete_mysql_sync:2.0.0`
- **Main application file:** `local:///app/driver.py`
- **Environment variables:** `DB_PASSWORD`: `9tVDVEKp`

:::info Environment variables
You can use **Environment variables** to store your sensitive variables like password, secrets, etc. Then you can use these variables in your config file using the <code>$\{DB_PASSWORD}</code> syntax.

### Config file

The following configuration file is used to set up the syncing of tables from a MySQL database to IOMETE Lakehouse. It specifies the source database connection details and the tables you want to sync.

:::info
Use the configuration file below as a template and modify it to fit your needs.
:::

**To add config file** scroll down and expand `Application configurations` section and click `Add config file` and paste following **HOCON**.

<Img src="/img/spark-job/spark-job-create-jdbc-sync-config-file.png" alt="IOMETE Spark job sync create spark job application configuration" />

```hocon
{
    source_connection: {
        host: "iomete-tutorial.cetmtjnompsh.eu-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
        port: 3306,
        username: tutorial_user,
        password: $\{DB_PASSWORD}
    },
    syncs: [
        {
            source.schema: employees
            source.tables: ["*"]
            source.exclude_tables: [departments, dept_manager]
            destination.schema: employees_raw
            sync_mode.type: full_load
        },
        {
            source.schema: employees
            source.tables: [ departments, dept_manager ]
            destination.schema: employees_raw
            sync_mode.type: full_load
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Source Connection

The `source_connection` object contains the following fields:

- **host**: The address of the MySQL database. For example, `iomete-tutorial.cetmtjnompsh.eu-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com`.
- **port**: The port number for the database connection, usually `3306` for MySQL.
- **username**: The username to connect to the database, like `tutorial_user`.
- **password**: The password for the database connection. Here, `${DB_PASSWORD}` is a variable that you can set in the **Environment variables** section.

:::info
The shown MySQL database is a sample database that you can use to test out IOMETE.
:::

#### Syncs Array

The `syncs` array contains one or more objects that specify what to sync:

Sync Object Fields

- **source.schema**: The schema in the source MySQL database you want to sync from, such as `employees`.
- **source.tables**: An array of table names you want to sync. Use `["*"]` to sync all tables.
- **source.exclude_tables**: _[Optional]_ An array of table names you want to exclude from syncing.
- **destination.schema**: The schema in the IOMETE Lakehouse where the data will be stored, like `employees_raw`.
- **sync_mode.type**: The type of sync.
  - `full_load` - Read everything in the source and overwrites whole table at the destination at each sync.
  - `incremental_snapshot` - It creates the snapshot of table in the destination and only move the newly inserted and updated records. While writing to IOMETE it uses merge statement. This mode requires two additional parameters:
    - `identification_column` - can be id or other primary key column that will be used on merge statement
    - `tracking_column` - column that will be used to track the where it should continue to get data from the source table. For example, if you want to sync only the records that were inserted or updated after the last sync, you can use the `updated_at` column as the `tracking_column`. The column should be increasing and updated with each insert or update.

:::info Example 1
This example syncs all tables from the `employees` schema, except for the `salaries` table, into the `employees_raw` schema in IOMETE Lakehouse.

```hocon
{
    source.schema: employees
    source.tables: ["*"]
    source.exclude_tables: [salaries]
    destination.schema: employees_raw
    sync_mode.type: full_load
}
```

:::

:::info Example 2
This example syncs only the `departments` and `dept_manager` tables from the `employees` schema into the `employees_dep` schema in IOMETE Lakehouse.

```hocon
{
    source.schema: employees
    source.tables: [departments, dept_manager]
    destination.schema: employees_raw
    sync_mode.type: full_load
}
```

:::

:::info Example 3
This example does incremental snapshot sync of the `salaries` table from the `employees` schema into the `employees_raw` schema in IOMETE Lakehouse.

```hocon
{
    source.schema: employees
    source.tables: [salaries]
    destination.schema: employees_raw
    sync_mode: {
      type: incremental_snapshot
      identification_column: id
      tracking_column: updated_at
    }
}
```

:::

:::info Example 3

- **source.schema**: `employees`
- **source.tables**: `[salaries]`
- **destination.schema**: `employees_raw`
- **sync_mode.type**: `incremental_snapshot`

This example syncs only the `departments` and `dept_manager` tables from the `employees` schema into the `employees_dep` schema in IOMETE Lakehouse.
:::

### Run the job

You can trigger the job manually by clicking on the <FlexButton label='Run' primary/> button.

:::tip
You can also schedule the job to run periodically. To do this, edit spark job and set the **Schedule** parameter.
