# Predictive Maintenance

**Predictive Maintenance** is a method of determining when an asset needs maintenance based on its actual condition, rather than a fixed schedule. By predicting and preventing failures, you can reduce costly equipment downtimes and maximize uptime and productivity.

With IoT and sensor data, manufacturers can effectively predict machine outages, detect variances, and identify patterns that may indicate a potential breakdown.

By using analytics and machine learning, manufacturers can accurately predict the odds of a machine going down and plan early and corrective measures to avoid unplanned downtime and costly staff and resources.
