# Hive Date Function

## What are Hive Date Functions?

**Hive** is a powerful tool for processing and querying data, and it comes with a wide range of built-in functions to help you get the most out of your data. These functions include string manipulation, date manipulation, mathematical functions, conditional operators, and more.

One of the most useful types of functions in Hive is the date function. With these functions, you can easily perform operations on date data types, such as adding or subtracting days from a date.

In addition to date functions, Hive also provides a range of other built-in functions, including mathematical functions, conditional functions, string functions, collection functions, type conversion functions, and table generating functions. Each of these functions is designed to help you manipulate and analyze your data in different ways.
