# DNA Sequencing

## What is DNA Sequencing?

**DNA sequencing** is the process of determining the exact sequence of nucleotides in DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). This involves determining the order of the four chemical building blocks - adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine - that make up the DNA molecule. The first methods for sequencing DNA were developed in the 1970s, and since then, technology has advanced to the point where labs can sequence well over 100,000 billion bases per year.

There are two main types of DNA sequencing: the Sanger method and the High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) method. The Sanger method is still used for determining the sequences of relatively long stretches of DNA, but the HTS method is characterized by improved accuracy and speed, as well as reduced manpower and cost.

The implementation of the HTS method has expanded the applications for genomics, making DNA sequencing an integral part of basic science, translational research, medical diagnostics, and forensics.
