# Jupyter Notebook

## What is a Jupyter Notebook?

A **Jupyter Notebook** is an open-source web application that allows data scientists to create and share documents containing live code, multimedia elements, and equations.

## What are Jupyter Notebooks used for?

Jupyter notebooks serve various data science purposes, such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning and transformation, data visualization, statistical modeling, machine learning, and deep learning.

## What are the benefits of using Jupyter Notebooks?

Jupyter notebooks excel at showcasing data team projects by combining code, markdown, links, and images. They offer a user-friendly experience and enable running code cell by cell for better comprehension.

Jupyter notebooks can be converted into numerous standard output formats (HTML, Powerpoint, LaTeX, PDF, ReStructuredText, Markdown, Python) via the web interface, making it simple for data scientists to share their work.

## How do Jupyter Notebooks work?

A Jupyter notebook comprises two parts: a front-end web page and a back-end kernel. The front-end web page allows data scientists to input programming code or text into rectangular "cells." The browser then sends the code to the back-end kernel, which executes the code and returns the results.

## What are the downsides of using Jupyter Notebooks?

- **Challenging to maintain and synchronize** when collaborating on code.
- **Hard to operationalize your code** due to the lack of built-in integration or tools for operationalizing machine learning models in Jupyter notebooks.
- **Difficult to scale**â€” Jupyter notebooks are designed for single-node data science. If your data exceeds your computer's memory capacity, using Jupyter notebooks becomes significantly more challenging.

## Are Jupyter Notebooks available on IOMETE?

IOMETE offers a powerful data science collaboration tool with its notebooks. Collaborate with colleagues across engineering, data science, and machine learning teams in multiple languages, featuring built-in data visualizations and operationalization through jobs.

## Does IOMETE provide support for Jupyter Notebooks?

Yes. IOMETE clusters can be configured to use the IPython kernel, leveraging the Jupyter ecosystem's open-source tools (display and output tools, for instance). IOMETE also supports importing and exporting .ipynb files, allowing seamless transitions between Jupyter notebooks and IOMETE.
