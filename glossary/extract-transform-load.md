# Extract Transform Load (ETL)

## What is Extract Transform Load (ETL)?

**ETL, or extract, transform, and load**, is a critical process for businesses looking to derive insights from their data. As data sources and types continue to grow, data engineering teams face increasing pressure to process raw data into clean, reliable data that can be used downstream.

ETL involves extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a usable format, and loading it into systems for end-users to access. This process can be done with ETL tools or custom code. One challenge with ETL is building and maintaining reliable data pipelines, which has become increasingly difficult as data sources and types continue to grow. Managing data quality in complex pipeline architectures is also a challenge, as bad data can devalue the entire data set. Despite these challenges, reliable ETL is critical for businesses looking to make data-driven decisions.
