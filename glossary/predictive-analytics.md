# Predictive Analytics

## What is Predictive Analytics?

**Predictive Analytics** is a powerful tool that uses advanced techniques to analyze both new and historical data, identifying patterns and predicting future outcomes and trends. By leveraging big data and applying algorithms to large data sets, organizations can find and exploit patterns within their data to detect risks and opportunities.

## How Does Predictive Analytics Work?

Predictive analytics uses a variety of techniques, including statistical analysis, data mining, and predictive modeling, to create predictive models that assign a numerical value to the likelihood of a particular event happening. These models can also incorporate what-if scenarios and risk assessment, allowing organizations to make confident real-time recommendations that reduce costs, improve safety, and inform investments.

Whether you're working with engineering data from sensors and connected systems or business system data like transaction data, sales results, customer complaints, and marketing information, predictive analytics can help you extract value from big data. By using tools like Hadoop and Spark, you can capture, store, and process large volumes of structured and unstructured data from a variety of sources, including connec
