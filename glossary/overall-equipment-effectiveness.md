# Overall Equipment Effectiveness

**Overall Equipment Effectiveness** is a measure of how well a manufacturing operation is being utilized compared to its full potential. By identifying the percentage of manufacturing time that is truly productive, one can gain important insights on how to systematically improve the manufacturing process.

Measuring OEE is a manufacturing best practice that can help one identify losses, benchmark progress, and improve the productivity of oneâ€™s manufacturing equipment. But what makes OEE truly powerful is its ability to guide one in implementing use cases that improve the components of OEE, such as the deployment of predictive maintenance to improve availability or quality control leveraging computer vision to improve quality.
