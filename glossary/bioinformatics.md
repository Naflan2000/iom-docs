## What is Bioinformatics?

Bioinformatics is a rapidly growing field that uses computation to extract knowledge from vast collections of biological data. It involves the use of IT in biotechnology for storing, retrieving, organizing, and analyzing biological data. With an enormous amount of data being generated by genome sequencing projects and other studies, bioinformatics has become essential for managing data in modern biology and medicine.

This interdisciplinary field combines knowledge from applied mathematics, informatics, statistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, chemistry, and biochemistry. Bioinformatics has numerous applications and research areas, including sequence analysis, prediction of protein structure, genome annotation, comparative genomics, health and drug discovery, waste cleanup, and biotechnology.
