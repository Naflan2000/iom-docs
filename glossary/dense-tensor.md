# Dense Tensor

## What is a Dense Tensor?

**Dense tensors** are a crucial component of multi-dimensional data analysis applications. They store values in a contiguous sequential block of memory, making them efficient for tensor computations. Popular software products like MATLAB and open source third-party toolboxes offer support for dense tensor operations.

Dense layers, which are fully connected layers, are typically used towards the end of a network and sometimes multiple times. For high-performance dense tensor applications, dten is a widely used library known for storing and manipulating dense tensors. It supports tensor matricization in different ways and provides a high degree of flexibility. Matricization is a conceptual restructuring of the tensor and can be thought of as the multidimensional generalization of a matrix.
