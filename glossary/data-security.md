# Data Security

## What is Data Security?

Data security is a set of practices and procedures designed to protect data from unauthorized access, theft, corruption, poisoning, or accidental loss. It involves safeguarding sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information, financial information, health information, and intellectual property, throughout the data lifecycle, from creation to destruction. Data security encompasses everything from the physical security of hardware and storage devices to administrative and access controls, security of software applications, and data governance policies.

## The Importance of Data Security

Data is one of the most critical assets for any organization today, so the importance of data security cannot be overstated. Protecting data is critical because data loss or misuse can have severe consequences for an organization, including reputational damage, inaccurate ML models, loss of business, and loss of brand equity. In addition, if an organization's intellectual property is compromised, its ability to compete may be permanently affected.

## Data Security Risks and How to Mitigate These

There are several types of data security risks, including malware, ransomware, phishing, DDoS attacks, human error, and insider threats. To mitigate these risks, organizations should implement robust data security strategies, including data encryption, data masking, data erasure, access management, and role-based access management. Data governance is also an essential security best practice that establishes processes that are enforced across organizations to ensure compliance and data security while enabling users to access the data they need to do their jobs.
