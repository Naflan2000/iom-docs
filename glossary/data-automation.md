# Data Automation

## What is Data Automation?

Data automation is a popular data management technique that can help organizations collect, upload, transform, store, process, and analyze data without the need for manual human intervention. By automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks such as data ingestion, transformation, validation, cleansing, integration, and analysis, data automation helps organizations make the most of their data and make data-driven decisions faster and easier.

One common example of data automation is Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL), which enables engineers to extract data from different sources, transform it into a usable and trusted resource, and load it into systems that end-users can access and use downstream to solve business problems.

Data automation can be applied to various data types, including structured and unstructured data, and can be used across different data sources, such as internal databases, external databases, cloud-based data sources, and data from third-party applications, web services, and APIs.

Data automation has several benefits, including improved data quality, cost savings, enhanced ability to generate insights, improved productivity, and enhanced speed of analytics. However, it can also have some limitations, such as initial investment costs, a learning curve for employees, and the need for human intervention for troubleshooting.

To develop a data automation strategy that aligns with your organization's business goals, consider prioritizing which processes to automate, identifying specific tasks to automate, choosing the right automation tools, and taking an incremental approach to automation. When selecting a data automation tool, look for scalability, observability, security, integration, and ease of use.
