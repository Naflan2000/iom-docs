## What is Demand Forecasting?

**Demand forecasting** is the process of projecting consumer demand to estimate future revenue. It involves projecting the assortment of products that shoppers will buy using both quantitative and qualitative data. Poor demand forecasting can lead to unavailable products at the time of consumer demand, causing companies to put the wrong product on the shelf or, even worse, to have in-store stock outages.
