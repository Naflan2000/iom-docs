# Open Banking

**Open Banking** is a revolutionary way to provide secure access to consumers' financial data, all with their consent.

By democratizing customer data to non-bank third parties, Open Banking is driving the industry towards hyper-relevant, platform-based distribution. With open banking, financial service institutions (FSIs) can expand access to customer data through APIs and other data sharing models. However, Open Banking integrations come with their own set of challenges, such as API performance and reliability, consumer worries, and the lack of standardized compliance standards.

The IOMETE data lakehouse offers real-time analytics, business intelligence, and AI capabilities on all data types through a secure, multi-cloud or on-premise environment.
