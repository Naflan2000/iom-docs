# Complex Event Processing

## What is Complex Event Processing (CEP)?

Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a technology used for querying data before storing it in a database or analyzing it in real-time without ever storing it. CEP is an organizational tool that helps to aggregate different information and identify cause-and-effect relationships among events in real-time, allowing you to proactively take effective actions. CEP is commonly used to address the following requirements: low latency, high volume of input events per second, and complex event patterns to be detected.

## Major Application Areas for Complex Event Processing (CEP)

CEP has major applications in the following areas:

- **Business Activity Monitoring:** Identifies problems and opportunities in early stages by monitoring business processes and other critical resources.

- **Sensor Networks:** Used for monitoring industrial facilities, usually derived from raw numerical measurements such as temperature and smoke.

- **Market Data:** Such as stock or commodity prices, derived from several events and their relationships through CEP.

## The Most Common Tools Used for Complex Event Processing

The most common tools used for CEP are:

- Apache Spark Streaming used by IOMETE
- Apache Flink used by data Artisans
- Apache Samza used by LinkedIn
- Apache Storm used by Twitter
- Hadoop/MapReduce
- Amazon Kinesis Analytics
- Microsoft Azure Stream Analytics, Stream Insight
- Fujitsu Software Interstage Big Data Complex Event Processing Server
- IBM Streams, Operational Decision Manager (ODM)
- Oracle Stream Analytics and Stream Explore

By using CEP, businesses can identify opportunities and threats in real-time, making it a valuable tool for organizations looking to stay ahead of the competition.
