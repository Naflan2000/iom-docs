## What is Spark Elasticsearch?

**Spark Elasticsearch** is a powerful, open-source, NoSQL distributed database that stores, retrieves, and manages document-oriented and semi-structured data. Used by thousands of top companies, including tech giants like Google, Oracle, and Microsoft, Elasticsearch is a flexible solution for indexing structured data. With its ecosystem of complementary open-source software and platforms, Elasticsearch is one of the easiest to implement and scale logging solutions. It's also perfect for full-text search, scraping and combining public data, and working with event data and metrics. To understand how Elasticsearch works, it's important to know its key components, including Elasticsearch clusters, nodes, ports, shards, replicas, analyzers, and documents.
