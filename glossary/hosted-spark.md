# Hosted Spark

## What is Hosted Spark?

**Hosted Spark** is a unified data platform that provides organizations with a simplified way to interact with Apache Spark, a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data.

With high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, Spark supports general computation graphs for data analysis, as well as several other tools such as Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark provides two modes for data exploration: interactive and batch. However, in the absence of direct access to Spark resources by remote applications, the user had to face a longer route to production. To overcome this obstacle, there are now services that enable remote apps to efficiently connect to a Spark cluster over a REST API from anywhere. Hosted Spark interfaces provide turnkey solutions that facilitate the interaction between Spark and application servers, streamlining the architecture required by interactive web and mobile apps.

Hosted Spark services provide interactive Scala, Python, and R coverings, batch submissions in Scala, Java, Python, and the ability for multiple users to share the same server. Users can submit jobs from anywhere through REST, and no code change is required to be done to your programs. By using Hosted Spark, organizations can easily overcome existing bottlenecks that impede their ability to operationalize Spark, and instead, focus on capturing the value promised by big data.
