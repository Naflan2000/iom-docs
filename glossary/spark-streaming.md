# Spark Streaming

## What is Spark Streaming?

**Spark Streaming** is a powerful and scalable streaming processing system that supports both batch and real-time workloads. However, it is now considered a legacy project with no further updates. Instead, data engineers and data scientists should turn to Spark Structured Streaming, a newer and easier-to-use streaming engine that seamlessly integrates with other Spark components like MLlib and Spark SQL. With Spark Structured Streaming, you can process real-time data from various sources and push the results to file systems, databases, and live dashboards. This unified approach to data processing offers unique benefits over traditional streaming systems, including fast recovery from failures, better load balancing, and native integration with advanced processing libraries like SQL, machine learning, and graph processing.
